Build
=====

Build the application and the distribution zip file with the build.sh file.  It simply runs `mvn clean assembly:assembly`.  That will result in a zip file in the target folder that can be uploaded to Java SE CS.


Run Locally
===========

On successful build, you can run the app with `sh target/bin/start` which is a shell script generated by the Maven build that constructs the correct classpath to dependencies in target/repo.


Deploy
======

Edit config.properties to set your target server, user id, password, and identity domain

Deploy the application archive using `deploy.sh`.  This will create the service instance and deploy.  


Redeploy
========

Once a service instance has been created, updated archives are deployed
